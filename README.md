Data Validation Toolset
==============

Steve's data set checking system.  Currently there are two parts to this:

1. Test data generation tool
2. The validator

The test data generation tool will generate test data which exhibits characteristics that are specified by the user
The validator will compare source and converted datasets using a specified rule set and output deviations
